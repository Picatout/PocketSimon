==========
Begin size optimization.

* Removed pause_table and modified pause subroutine, save 7 instructions.

* Removed led_tris_table, modified led_gpio_table to include data that was in led_tris_table and modified
  led_on subroutine, saved 5 instructions.

* read_button subroutine optimization:
  Use cap_cnt rollover as timeout instead of TC_MAX comparison, saved 3 instructions. 
  Needed to increment GRN_CNT value from 20 to 32 as charging time loop 
  dropped from 8 TCY to 5 TCY.

* store_note subroutine optimization:
  * changed the code to divide index/4, saved 4 instructions. No need to clear carry
    before rrf because FSR is only 5 bits the contain of bits 7,6 have no effect on
    addition.
  * by reversing order of slots in byte and rewriting code saved 2 instructions.

* load_note subroutine optimization:
  * rewriting code to compute FSR pointer saved 3 instructions.
  * rewriting rotate code saved another 3 instructions.

* wait_btn_release subroutine optimization:
  * a rewrite of read_buttons to ensure the carry bit is set at return
    when no button is down enable to rewrite wait_btn_release to save 2 instructions
    and save 6 instructions in main routine.

* note subroutine optimization:
  * At beginning of subroutine replaced 
      movwf t0
      movlw 0x1F
      andwf t0,W
    by
      movwf t0
      andlw 0x1F 
    as value of t0 is already in W this save 1 instruction.
  * Replaced this:
        movlw 0xE0
        andwf t0,W
        movwf t1
        swapf t1,F
        rrf t1,F
        movf t1,F
        skpnz
    by
        swapf t0,W
        movwf t1
        rrf t1,F
        movlw 0x7
        andwf t1,F
        skpnz
    saving 1 instruction.
  * Rewriting tone generation loop saved 5 more instructions.

* main routine optimization
  * Removed the silent LEDs sweep awhile waiting for start signal. Now
    loop in POST instead. Saved 15 instructions.
  * replacing 
        case 32, victory_final
    by
        xorlw 32
        skpnz
        goto victory_final
    sacved 1 instruction.
  * Reordering somes instructions in init and play_victory saved 1 more instruction.
  * No more use of timeout to seed rand instead use TMR0 count, saved 1 instruction.
